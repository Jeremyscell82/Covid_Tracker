# COVID TRACKING

In 2020 news comes in all shapes and sizes and some may even still be telling the truth, but they are hard to find these covid days. So I decided to build an application based off sources of truth to help (at least me) determine which story is false faster, sources listed below.

## Getting Started

Typically I go to google.com and do a search for 'covid count {state name here}', this only works on the desktop version as you get a mix of data on the mobile device version of chrome. So on mobile I just have to hope what I am hearing is false and remember to check it later until now.

## Prerequisites

FIND THE SOURCE OF TRUTH, those came from several different websites many with out an endpoint for me to build an application from... until I found these two websites that are collecting the data from creditable sources and have built an endpoint for me to use.

## Installing

Click on the 'Download app' link below, once completed install the application and (if you trust me) accept the warnings and install anyway.

## Sources

World data collected by About-Corona.net, provided by John Hopkins, WHO situation reports, NHC, ECDC, CCDC

USA data collected by covidtracking.com, this data is collected manunally from each states official health website displaying the counts to the puplic.
